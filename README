1. Basic info
A clone of the old asteroids game using slightly more modern graphics. The
graphics are implemented using native Java libraries and also include a very
primitive particle system. It also features an exclusive fullscreen port
using the BufferStrategy object.

2. Build project
Make sure that you have make installed as well as a version of JDK (JDK-6
should be fine, however this project was tested with JDK-8). Execute the
following commands to build and run:

git clone https://github.com/Paradime987/asteroids.git
cd asteroids
mkdir out
make
make exec
